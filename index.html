    <p><strong><h2>Create a Website using HTML (Basic)</h2></strong></p>
    <p>There are basically two make a web page.The first way is to create the page<sup>(s)</sup> offline <br> and then
        upload them
        to your Internet Service Provider (<strong>ISP</strong>) via <strong>FTP</strong>. The second way is to <br>
        create your web pages<sub>(s)</sub> online using
        a Talent program by accessing your <strong>UNIX</strong> accoount. if you <br> have one.</p>

    <p>If you are creating your web pages(s) offline. do so in any test editing or word processing <br> document. Make
        sure when you save you document, you save it as a <q>text</q>, <q>plain text</q> or <br> <q>text only</q>
        document. Otherwise it will not be read properly by a web browser. Once you have <br> created your pages(s). you
        will need to contact your <strong>ISP</strong> about
        how to go about uploading them to <br> your server.</p>

    <p>If you have a <strong>UNIX</strong> account, you can create your web page(s) online. You first need to get a <br>
        program that can access your <strong>UNIX</strong> account. <b>I</b> recommended Telent for the Mac or Ewan for
        <br> windows <s>95/98</s>.
    </p>

    <p>Once you can access your account, you need to make a new directory called <q>public_html</q>.</p>

    <p><strong>mkdir public_html</strong></p>

    <p>After this, changes your directory to this new directory called <q>public_html</q>.</p>

    <p><strong>cd public_html</strong></p>

    <p>If you want to, you can make other directories. one for all the web pages thet you make. and one <br> for all of
        the graphics that you have. Follow the same steps as above to do this.</p>

    <p>Next, you need to think of a filename for your page (this is not a title, but will be in the <br> URL). Acommon
        filename for a main web page. is <q>index</q>. Once you've decided on this, add <br> <q>.html</q> to the end of
        it. Then type (i.e.)</p>

    <p><strong>pico index.html</strong></p>

    <p>Of course, use your page's filename, instead of this one. Next, you need to again some knowledge <br> of the many
        <strong>HTML</strong> commands. Lucky for you, I've already gotten some the basic commands <br> for you. Follow
        the index below, to decide what to put on your page, and how to do it. Once <br> you've gotten started. exit your
        page. You can do this by pressing <strong>control-x</strong>. Then you need to <br> type:</p>

    <p><strong>chmod 744 index.html</strong></p>

    <p>Only do this with the filename of your page. You only need to do this the very first time that you <br> leave
        your web page. This command will make sure taht nobody else can delete your page. You <br> will need to do this
        to any other pages taht make in the future. Then, look at you page on</p>
